## Resubmission
This is a re-submission. In this version I have:

* Changed the format of the in-text citation in the DESCRIPTION to "Rakthanmanon et al. (2012) <DOI:10.1145/2339530.2339576>".
* Increased version number to 0.1.1

## Release summary

This is a re-submission of the first CRAN release of deBInfer.


## Test environments
* OS X 10.11.6 (on travis-ci) R 3.3.2 and R-devel (2016-10-26 r71594)
* Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS (on travis-ci) R 3.3.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE on win-builder:

* New submission

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Rakthanmanon (15:61)
  UCR (3:27, 15:48)
  al (15:77)
  et (15:74)
  subsequence (15:143)
  ultrafast (15:133)



* The note was for the package being a first-time submission.
  Furthermore six words were highlighted as possibly mis-spelled. The first four result from an in text citation to the C++ library that this submission provides R bindings for, the second two stem from the terminology that is used by the original authors of the C++ library.
